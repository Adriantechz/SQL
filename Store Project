-- in this project i created a Table called store and input all the data to run a query.

Create TABLE Store (id integer PRIMARY KEY,quantity_sold integer,quantity_instock integer, item text, cost integer);
INSERT INTO store VALUES (1,100,66, "Bread",7);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (2,20,4, " Ketchup", 3);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (3,30,12, "Apple", 4);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (4,200,70, "Juice box", 5);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (5,60,1, "Banana", 3);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (6,5,2, "diaper", 20);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (7,30,3, "ice cream", 17);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (8,12,14, "20lbs rice", 7);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (9,16,10, "cereal", 14);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (10,17,0, "Chicken quarters", 18);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (11,22,5, "Beef stew", 8);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (12,24,100 ,"hot dog", 10);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (13,55,60, "bagel", 8);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (14,17, 15,"toilet paper", 12);
INSERT INTO Store VALUES (15,33,20, "cream cheese", 3);


--Shows the quantity in stock  for each item in the store, this is use to understand the variation in stock level across different items in the stores inventory--
Select item,quantity_instock from Store;

-- Calculate summary that gives insight into the overall distribution and variation in stock levels across the store's inventory
SELECT 
    MIN(quantity_instock) AS min_quantity_instock,
    MAX(quantity_instock) AS max_quantity_instock,
    AVG(quantity_instock) AS mean_quantity_instock,
    (SELECT quantity_instock
     FROM Store
     ORDER BY quantity_instock
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Store) / 2) AS median_quantity_instock
FROM Store;
