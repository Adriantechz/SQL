-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


--Created the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );




-- first i determined who the top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name,popularity AS Most_popular_song
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
Order by popularity DESC
limit 10;

-- Then i determined who are the top 10 artists with the most songs and how many song do they have
SELECT count(track_name) AS Number_of_songs, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) DESC
limit 10;
